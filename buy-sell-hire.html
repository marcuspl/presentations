This is a highly opinionated and hasty presentation that was originally asked to be something like:
"stuff non-technical aspiring entrepreneurs should know about programmers and how to get them" or something.

A part of the TOC was selected as the title of the full presentation and shifted it a bit toward the 
question of how to buy your technical development. 

We'll see how it goes.

        <h2>Accidental Complexity</h2>
        <section>
          <i>Key concept to understand why software development is hard</i>
        </section>

        <section>
          <i>"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler"</i>
        </section>

        <section>
          As a project grows, the requirements change. A simple analogy might be a company. The amount of "stuff" needed to deal with itself is very different between a one-man startup and big company with hundreds of employees.
        </section>

        <section>
          The accumulated accidental complexity of a project is called <i>technical debt</i>.
        </section>

        <section>
          The correct <i>level of abstraction</i> or implementation is a <strong>moving target</strong> and will change with:<ul><li class="fragment">the size of the code base<li class="fragment">the competence and size of the team<li class="fragment">quality requirements of the code base
        </section>

        <section>
          We are basically always choosing between:<ul>
            <li class="fragment">accumulating technical debt in the form of
              <ul>
                <li class="fragment">accidental complexity (things got more complicated than they should be)
                <li class="fragment">shortcuts (not complex enough but good for now)
              </ul>
            <li class="fragment">Re-writing old code to an adequate level of complexity
        </section>

        <section>
          This is important to know when starting with technological development because either:
          <ol>
            <li class="fragment">Slower start but last longer (spend time estimating the complexity of the problem, choosing tools etc.)
            <li class="fragment">Fast start but risk of productivity stagnation
          </ol>
          For an MVP or even for PMF-level product, the latter might be the right choice. <strong>Something always trumps nothing.</strong>
        </section>

        <section>
          This concept applies also to the aspiring entrepreneur, because so much of what is required when starting a company is accidental complexity compared to the original value proposition.

        <h2>Cruft</h2>
        <section>
          <i>From the hacker-jargon file:</i>
          <pre>
  crufty: /kruhftee/, adj.
  [very common; origin unknown; poss. from ‘crusty’ or ‘cruddy’]

  1. Poorly built, possibly over-complex.[...] 

  2. Unpleasant, especially to the touch, often with encrusted junk. 
     Like spilled coffee smeared with peanut butter and catsup.

  3. Generally unpleasant.
          </pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <i>Also From the hacker-jargon file:</i>
          <pre>
          cruft: /kruhft/
[very common; back-formation from crufty]

1. n. An unpleasant substance. The dust that gathers under your bed 
      is cruft; [...] attacking it with a broom only produces more.

2. n. The results of shoddy construction.

3. vt. [...]

4. n. Excess; superfluous junk; used esp. of redundant or 
      superseded code.
        </section>
        <section>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment">Cruft is the reason no programmer wants to pick up an abandoned project.
            <li class="fragment">And therefor why you should put a lot of thought into getting the team right the first time.
            <li class="fragment">This only applies if the project has been abandoned, ie, the original team is not available any more.
            <li class="fragment">Most teams coming to an abandoned project will want to rewrite from scratch. It is very hard to know if it is the right thing todo.

      <section>
        All this to talk about ...
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Uncertainty and estimation</H3>
        <section>
          Software estimation is considered a black art.
        </section>

        <section>
          Notoriously hard.
        </section>

        <section>
          We always get it wrong. Even when we know we always get it wrong.
        </section>

        <section>
          Compared to the construction industry.
        </section>

        <section>
          How hard can it be? Attempt #1: Novice.
          <ol><li class="fragment">Write a spec. <li class="fragment">Ask a programmer how long he needs to build it?</li></ol>
          <p>
          This approach has been proven to always be wrong.
        </section>

        <section>
          Attempt #2: Project manager.
          <ol><li class="fragment">Write a spec. <li class="fragment">Ask a programmer how long he needs to build it?<li class="fragment">Multiply programmer's answers with 2.</ol>
          <p/>
          Better but mostly wrong.
        </section>

        <section>
          Attempt #3: Experienced project manager.
          <ol><li class="fragment">Write a spec. <li class="fragment">Ask a programmer how long he needs to build it?<li class="fragment">Multiply programmer's answers with PI.</ol>
          <p/>
          Getting closer.
        </section>

        <section>
          Attempt #4: Industrial company attempt to normalize it.
          <ol>
            <li class="fragment">Write a spec. 
            <li class="fragment">Ask a programmer how long he needs to build it?
            <li class="fragment">Ask programmer's colleague how long he needs to build it.
            <li class="fragment">Ask programmer's boss how long he needs to build it.
            <li class="fragment">Ask each person to give a pessimistic, an optimistic and a reasonable option.
            <li class="fragment">Take the avarage of the pessimistic answers.
          </ol>
          <p/>
          It will still be wrong but it will be better.
        </section>

        <section>
          All of this is also assuming that the specs are near perfect. Which they are not.
