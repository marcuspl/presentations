This is a highly opinionated and hasty presentation that was originally asked to be something like:
"stuff non-technical aspiring entrepreneurs should know about programmers and how to get them" or something.

A part of the TOC was selected as the title of the full presentation and shifted it a bit toward the 
question of how to buy your technical development. 

We'll see how it goes.

        <h2>Accidental Complexity</h2>
        <section>
          <i>Key concept to understand why software development is hard</i>
        </section>

        <section>
          <i>"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler"</i>
        </section>

        <section>
          As a project grows, the requirements change. A simple analogy might be a company. The amount of "stuff" needed to deal with itself is very different between a one-man startup and big company with hundreds of employees.
        </section>

        <section>
          The accumulated accidental complexity of a project is called <i>technical debt</i>.
        </section>

        <section>
          The correct <i>level of abstraction</i> or implementation is a <strong>moving target</strong> and will change with:<ul><li class="fragment">the size of the code base<li class="fragment">the competence and size of the team<li class="fragment">quality requirements of the code base
        </section>

        <section>
          We are basically always choosing between:<ul>
            <li class="fragment">accumulating technical debt in the form of
              <ul>
                <li class="fragment">accidental complexity (things got more complicated than they should be)
                <li class="fragment">shortcuts (not complex enough but good for now)
              </ul>
            <li class="fragment">Re-writing old code to an adequate level of complexity
        </section>

        <section>
          This is important to know when starting with technological development because either:
          <ol>
            <li class="fragment">Slower start but last longer (spend time estimating the complexity of the problem, choosing tools etc.)
            <li class="fragment">Fast start but risk of productivity stagnation
          </ol>
          <div class="fragment">
            For an MVP or even for PMF-level product, the latter might be the right choice. <strong>Something always trumps nothing.</strong>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          This concept applies also to the aspiring entrepreneur, because so much of what is required when starting a company is accidental complexity compared to the original value proposition.

        <h2>Cruft</h2>
        <section>
          <i>From the hacker-jargon file:</i>
          <pre>
  crufty: /kruhftee/, adj.
  [very common; origin unknown; poss. from ‘crusty’ or ‘cruddy’]

  1. Poorly built, possibly over-complex.[...] 

  2. Unpleasant, especially to the touch, often with encrusted junk. 
     Like spilled coffee smeared with peanut butter and catsup.

  3. Generally unpleasant.
          </pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <i>Also From the hacker-jargon file:</i>
          <pre>
          cruft: /kruhft/
[very common; back-formation from crufty]

1. n. An unpleasant substance. The dust that gathers under your bed 
      is cruft; [...] attacking it with a broom only produces more.

2. n. The results of shoddy construction.

3. vt. [...]

4. n. Excess; superfluous junk; used esp. of redundant or 
      superseded code.
        </section>
        <section>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment">Cruft is the reason no programmer wants to pick up an abandoned project.
            <li class="fragment">And therefor why you should put a lot of thought into getting the team right the first time.
            <li class="fragment">This only applies if the project has been abandoned, ie, the original team is not available any more.
            <li class="fragment">Most teams coming to an abandoned project will want to rewrite from scratch. It is very hard to know if it is the right thing todo.

            Better but mostly wrong.

          Attempt #4: Industrial company attempt to normalize it.

            <li class="fragment">Write a spec. 
            <li class="fragment">Ask a programmer how long he needs to build it?
            <li class="fragment">Ask programmer's colleague how long he needs to build it.
            <li class="fragment">Ask programmer's boss how long he needs to build it.
            <li class="fragment">Ask each person to give a pessimistic, an optimistic and a reasonable option.

          All of this is also assuming that the specs are near perfect. Which they are not.
