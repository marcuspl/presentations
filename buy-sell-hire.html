        <h2>Accidental Complexity</h2>
        <section>
          <i>Key concept to understand why software development is hard</i>
        </section>

        <section>
          <i>"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler"</i>
        </section>

        <section>
          As a project grows, the requirements change. A simple analogy might be a company. The amount of "stuff" needed to deal with itself is very different between a one-man startup and big company with hundreds of employees.
        </section>

        <section>
          The accumulated accidental complexity of a project is called <i>technical debt</i>.
        </section>

        <section>
          The correct <i>level of abstraction</i> or implementation is a <strong>moving target</strong> and will change with:<ul><li>the size of the code base<li>the competence and size of the team<li>quality requirements of the code base
        </section>

        <section>
          We are basically always choosing between:<ul>
            <li>accumulating technical debt in the form of
              <ul>
                <li>accidental complexity (things got more complicated than they should be)
                <li>shortcuts (not complex enough but good for now)
              </ul>
            <li>Re-writing old code to an adequate level of complexity
        </section>

        <section>
          This is important to know when starting with technological development because either:
          <ol>
            <li>Slower start but last longer (spend time estimating the complexity of the problem, choosing tools etc.)
            <li>Fast start but risk of productivity stagnation
          </ol>
          For an MVP or even for PMF-level product, the latter might be the right choice. <strong>Something always trumps nothing.</strong>
        </section>

        <section>
          This concept applies also to the aspiring entrepreneur, because so much of what is required when starting a company is accidental complexity compared to the original value proposition.

        <h2>Cruft</h2>
        <section>
          <i>From the hacker-jargon file:</i>
          <pre>
  crufty: /kruhftee/, adj.
  [very common; origin unknown; poss. from ‘crusty’ or ‘cruddy’]

  1. Poorly built, possibly over-complex.[...] 

  2. Unpleasant, especially to the touch, often with encrusted junk. 
     Like spilled coffee smeared with peanut butter and catsup.

  3. Generally unpleasant.
          </pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <i>Also From the hacker-jargon file:</i>
          <pre>
          cruft: /kruhft/
[very common; back-formation from crufty]

1. n. An unpleasant substance. The dust that gathers under your bed 
      is cruft; [...] attacking it with a broom only produces more.

2. n. The results of shoddy construction.

3. vt. [...]

4. n. Excess; superfluous junk; used esp. of redundant or 
      superseded code.
        </section>
        <section>
          <ul>
            <li>Cruft is the reason no programmer wants to pick up an abandoned project.
            <li>And therefor why you should put a lot of thought into getting the team right the first time.
            <li>This only applies if the project has been abandoned, ie, the original team is not available any more.
            <li>Most teams coming to an abandoned project will want to rewrite from scratch. It is very hard to know if it is the right thing todo.

          How hard can it be? Attempt #1: Novice.
          <ol><li>Write a spec. <li>Ask a programmer how long he needs to build it?</li></ol>
          <p>
          This approach has been proven to always be wrong.
        </section>

        <section>
          Attempt #2: Project manager.
          <ol><li>Write a spec. <li>Ask a programmer how long he needs to build it?<li>Multiply programmer's answers with 2.</ol>
          <p/>
          Better but mostly wrong.
        </section>

        <section>
          Attempt #3: Experienced project manager.
          <ol><li>Write a spec. <li>Ask a programmer how long he needs to build it?<li>Multiply programmer's answers with PI.</ol>
          <p/>
          Getting closer.
        </section>

        <section>
          Attempt #4: Industrial company attempt to normalize it.
          <ol>
            <li>Write a spec. 
            <li>Ask a programmer how long he needs to build it?
            <li>Ask programmer's colleague how long he needs to build it.
            <li>Ask programmer's boss how long he needs to build it.
            <li>Ask each person to give a pessimistic, an optimistic and a reasonable option.
            <li>Take the avarage of the pessimistic answers.
          </ol>
          <p/>
          It will still be wrong but it will be better.
        </section>

        <section>
          All of this is also assuming that the specs are near perfect. Which they are not.

          The benefits of <b>not</b> doing things inhouse
          <ul>
            <li>Something else is your bottleneck (highly unlikely in the early stages)
            <li>Inability or unwillingness to partake of the process
            <li>A trivial enough product that is done when it is done and you don't have to think about it
          </ul>

        <h3>Github</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Get on there. Not an option.
          <li>Take ownership of the development of your product.
          <li>Minimize boilerplate when onboarding.
          <li>Makes you less sensitive to teams or developers leaving.
          <li>Excellent for content production.
          <li>Allows for manic founders to control product details.
        </ul>
      </section>

          <li>Has wiki for documentation.
          <li>Has "issues" that can be used as a ticket-system.
          <li>"Natively" supports trying out new stuff and pivoting with so called branches.
          <li>Keeps track of developer productivity.
          <li>Good place to collect specifications and design as well.
        </ul>

        <h3>Know what you want</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A LOT of software development is about specifications.
          <li>Specifications is partly about knowing what you want.
          <li>Start specifying your product in any way you can.
          <li>Be creative!
          <li>(Almost) NOTHING in your product is going to show up without you intending it.
          <li>More below.
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>User Stories</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Write down all the things the user is going to be able to do as stories.
          <li>User logs in. Sees list of things. Clicks on first thing. Logs out. <i>etc.</i>
          <li>Google "user stories" but don't get caught up in format or formalities.
          <li>Basically, if you give the stories to a developer, your product will be build. That's the goal.
          <li>VERY powerful tool.
          <li>Upload them to github to track changes. ;)
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Produce Content</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Developers often use placeholder text: Lorem Ipsum.
          <li>The content is part of your product.
          <li>Get help from copy-writers.
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Design doesn't have to be nice (but can be!)
          <li>Get your pens and papers out and draw the different views of the product
          <li>... and their different states.
          <li>Get a designer or do it yourself!
          <li>A lot of our early pitches was showing a pdf that the designer made!
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Excel and data modeling</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>If your product contains different states of data - mock it in excel or similar
          <li>Even if the data is too advanced, try to write down what you believe it will be
          <li>Workflow based on states of data could and should be easily modelled in Excel.
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Dummy Prototypes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Check out <a href="https://github.com/marcuspl/product-dummy-dummy">Product-dummy-dummy</a>
          <li>Take subset of html (that you'll learn in 15 minutes) and start building your prototype.
          <li>Skip all logic (login forms just doesn nothing) and mock all data.
          <li>Try to cover your full product.
          <li>Make a site-map of it.
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>UI Design Tools</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I love Ionic but haven't yet tried their <a href="https://creator.ionic.io/">App Creator</a>
          <li>Google "user interface sketch" "ui mockups" etc.
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Keep moving!</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>All of the above things count as building your product
          <li>Discovering what your product should be counts as development
          <li>Part of a product is abstract. It doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
          <li>While waiting for the perfect technical team there is a ton of stuff to do!
        </ul>
